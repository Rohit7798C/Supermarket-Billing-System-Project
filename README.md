# Supermarket-Billing-System-in-C++
Developed a C++ supermarket billing system utilizing file handling for product data management. Implemented a product inventory and billing system in C++ with file I/O for efficient data storage and retrieval. (This focuses on the practical application and file I/O aspect.)
We can also add UI to this project by using MFC. We need to use Visual Studio to built the UI using the MFC.
